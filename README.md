## Setup

Add to your `build.sbt` following resolver with dependency:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("autoscout24", "maven")
resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo // For transitive dependencies

libraryDependencies += "com.autoscout24" %% "toguru-scala-client" % "(see version number above)",
```

## Basic usage in Scala Play

To toggle code with this client, you need to perform the following steps.

Create a Toguru client - e.g. in the Guice module of your Play
application so that it can be injected wherever you need it. For this,
you need to define
* how toggling-relevant client information (e.g. client id and custom
  attributes like culture) can be extracted from a Play request, and
* the Toguru server where the toggle activation conditions can be fetched from.

```scala
import play.api.mvc._
import toguru.play._
import toguru.play.PlaySupport._

val client: PlayClientProvider = { implicit request =>
  ClientInfo(uuidFromCookieValue("myVisitor"), forcedToggle)
}

val toguru = PlaySupport.toguruClient(client, "http://localhost:9000")
```

Define a toggle using a toggle id and a default activation condition, e.g.
in an object that contains all your toggles. The activation condition
will be fetched from the Toguru server based on the toggle id. The
fallback is used if the server can't be reached or the toggle id isn't
in the server's toggle state response.

```scala
val toggle = Toggle("my-toggle", default = Condition.Off)
```

Now, you can determine the state of your toggle based on the client info
and the toggle activation condition from the Toguru server:

```scala
implicit val toggling = toguru(request)

if(toggle.isOn)
  Ok("Toggle is on")
else
  Ok("Toggle is off")
```

## Support for Fan-Out Requests

In a microservice environment, a request to a service can produce multiple
sub-requests. When doing feature toggling, it is important to keep the toggle
state consistent over the sub-requests for a main request.

To do this you can
* define the service a toggle belongs to, and
* pass the toggle state along with the request to the owning service.

Here is how this would look like for a service included via [nginx server-side includes](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssi_module.html#commands):

### Defining the service or services a toggle belongs to 
Use `service` or `services` tag to identify all toggles to be passed along. 
You can edit toggle tags at https://toguru-panel.tools.autoscout24.com/#/ 
Let's assume, we have some toggles defined as shown below. First three of them are related to `owning-service`
```json
{
  id: "toggle1",
  tags: {
    service: "owning-service"
  },
  rolloutPercentage: 100
},
{
  id: "toggle2",
  tags: {
    services: "owning-service"
  },
  rolloutPercentage: 0
},
{
  id: "toggle3",
  tags: {
    services: "another-owning-service,owning-service"
  },
  rolloutPercentage: 100
},
{
  id: "toggle4",
  tags: {
    service: "another-owning-service"
  },
  rolloutPercentage: 100
}

```

### Passing the toggle state
The library has already the function to build toggle string 
for a given service name (it takes only `service` and `services` tags into consideration). 
See the examples below:
```scala
  import toguru.implicits.toggle._

  def function(...)(implicit toggling: Toggling): Unit = {
    toggling.toggleStringForService("owning-service") // This would return: toggle1=true|toggle2=false|toggle3=true

    toggling.toggleStringForService("another-owning-service") // This would return: toggle3=true|toggle4=true
  }
```

If you used another tag, you can build the toggle string as shown below:

```scala
  import toguru.implicits.toggle._

  val toggleInfo: TogglingInfo = ...
  val toggleString = toggleInfo()
    .filter { _.tags.get("some-custom-tag").contains("owning-service") }
    .buildString
```

In your html template (passing through `toggleString`), you can then pass the
toggle state using the `toguru` query parameter:

```
  @Html(s"""<!--#include virtual="/fragment/contentservice/header.html?toguru=${toggleString}" -->""")
```

Other ways to pass toggle string along:
* the `x-toguru` or `toguru` header
* the `toguru` cookie

For details, see the [forcedToggle](https://github.com/AutoScout24/toguru-scala-client/blob/master/src/main/scala/toguru/play/AbstractPlaySupport.scala#L51) method.

## Play support

The Toguru Scala client offers several convenience utilities, however.
To begin with, you can create a toggled controller based on the Toguru
client that your controllers can extend from:

```scala
import play.api.mvc._
import toguru.play._

abstract class ToggledController(toguru: PlayToguruClient) extends Controller {
  val ToggledAction = PlaySupport.ToggledAction(toguru)
}
```

Now you can define your controller with toggled actions and use the
toggle defined earlier to control which code gets executed:

```scala
class MyController @Inject()(toguru: PlayToguruClient) extends ToggledController(toguru) {

  def myAction = ToggledAction { implicit request =>
    if(toggle.isOn)
      Ok("Toggle is on")
    else
      Ok("Toggle is off")
  }
}
```

the request gets enriched with toggling information that is passed into
the toggle.isOn method.

## Custom request enrichment

If you need to enrich the request yourself or can't use PlaySupport's
ToggledAction, you can either apply the `Toggling` trait to your request:

```scala
class MyRequest[A](toguru: PlayToguruClient, request : Request[A])
        extends WrappedRequest[A](request) with Toggling {

  override val client = toguru.clientProvider(request)

  override val activations = toguru.activationsProvider()
}
```

Alternatively, you can always create the toggle information yourself:

```scala
class MyControllerWithOwnTogglingInfo @Inject()(toguru: PlayToguruClient) extends Controller {

  def myAction = Action { request =>
    implicit val toggling = toguru(request)

    if(toggle.isOn)
      Ok("Toggle is on")
    else
      Ok("Toggle is off")
  }
}
```

## Custom client attributes

`ClientInfo` provides means to enrich it with custom attributes. When Creating
a `ClientInfo.Provider`, attributes can be added by using `withAttribute`.
`PlaySupport` offers `fromCookie` and `fromHeader` methods that allow set
custom attribute from a cookie value or a request header, respectively.
Note that the custom attribute will not be set if the cookie or header is
missing.

For example, setting the custom attribute from a cookie named `culture` can be
done like this:

```
val client: PlayClientProvider = { implicit request =>
  ClientInfo(uuidFromCookieValue("myVisitor"), forcedToggle).withAttribute(fromCookie("culture"))
}
```

By this, the activation of a toggle can be controlled based on the value of
custom attributes. 

In Toguru you would configure:
```
  { "rollout": { "percentage": 100 }, "attributes": { "culture": ["de-DE"] }}
```
This would activate the feature toggle for all persons with `de-DE` as `culture` cookie value.

## Testing toggled code

In your tests, you can also define different activation conditions by using
the TestActivations class.

```scala
import toguru.test.TestActivations

val toguruClient = PlaySupport.testToguruClient(client, TestActivations(toggle -> Condition.On)())

val controller = new MyController(toguruClient)
```

see the [PlaySupport spec](src/test/scala/toguru/play/PlaySupportSpec.scala) for
full usage examples in Scala Play.

## Pitfalls
* To activate the toggling based on custom client attributes there must be a non-zero rollout percentage configured. Rollout percentage and one or more attributes are logically conjuncted.
* The client id has to be set in `ClientInfo` for the toggling to work properly
